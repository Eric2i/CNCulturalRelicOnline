# CNCulturalRelicOnline
## Project Overview
This GitHub repository contains the code for a project that aims to build a comprehensive knowledge graph of cultural relics from multiple sources, and provide various knowledge services based on the graph. The project consists of five subsystems, including:

- Data Crawling Subsystem: responsible for crawling data of cultural relics from various websites and saving the data to a unified format.
- Knowledge Graph Construction Subsystem: responsible for constructing a knowledge graph of cultural relics based on the crawled data, and maintaining the graph by updating and cleaning the data.
- Knowledge Querying Subsystem: responsible for providing users with a search interface to query the knowledge graph, and returning the relevant information of cultural relics.
- Knowledge Visualization Subsystem: responsible for visualizing the knowledge graph of cultural relics in a user-friendly way, such as a timeline or a relationship graph.
- Overseas Relics Knowledge Service Subsystem: responsible for providing overseas cultural relics information and knowledge services, including querying and visualizing.

Each subsystem is designed to work independently, with clear interfaces defined between them. The code for each subsystem is located in its own directory in this repository.
